// The deck's forest floor: one scene stack at stage level, reusing the landing
// page's woodland plates (public/landing/forest) so /pitch and / are one
// artifact. Five zones cover the walk — night (dense wood, no path), pine
// (marked trail under the canopy), moss (the forest floor as a reading
// surface), paper (the civic record), clearing (arrival, warm light). All five
// stay mounted and crossfade in CSS, so slide changes never flash a bare
// stage. A single dusk sheet above the art carries the deck's lighting arc:
// `light` runs 0 (lost in the dark) to 1 (the clearing), and the sheet's
// opacity is just (1 - light) scaled — the story gets brighter as the walk
// approaches the ask.
